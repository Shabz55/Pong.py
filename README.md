# Pong Game (Python)

A simple yet fun implementation of the classic **Pong** game using **Pygame**. This project features basic game mechanics including two-player paddle control, scoring, collision detection, and randomized ball dynamics for an engaging retro-style arcade experience.

## Features

- Two-player local Pong game  
- Paddle movement using keyboard controls (W/A & P/L keys)  
- Ball collision with paddles and walls  
- Randomized ball velocity after paddle collisions  
- Score tracking and game over when a player reaches 11 points  
- Basic color feedback on paddle hits

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pygame (for graphics and game loop)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Install **pygame** if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

## Controls

**Left Paddle (Player 1):**  
- Move Up: `Q`  
- Move Down: `A`

**Right Paddle (Player 2):**
